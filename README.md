q1: did not test for file open errors (-2)

1. (10 pts) Write a complete program in C++ that reads the file grades.txt Download grades.txt(attached in lab description) where each line contains a student name followed by their test score. Your program should find who has the highest grade and who has the second highest grade and write the results to an output file scoreReport.txt. If there is more than one student with the same highest or second highest score, outputting any of them is fine.

Make sure to test for file open errors aka file validation (during input and output).

Sample input file and output file:

Input (grades.txt):

John 85
Jane 95
Joe 80
Output (scoreReport.txt):

Highest score: Jane 95
Second highest score: John 85
